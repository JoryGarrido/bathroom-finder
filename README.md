# Site

## Pages:
- Landing page: accessible to guests, shows list of nearby restrooms and ratings
- Map page: same info in map view
- Info pages on each restroom (one route/view for all)
- User pages: allows account creation/access, then uses preferences when on main page (ie. display only 3 stars and above), add restrooms and edit if author, or add additional comments
- Admin pages: add/edit/remove all content


## Requirements:
- Mobile first
- MVP must have basic location finder (automated or set by user, whatever's easier)


## Stretch goals:
- Use phone's GPS for location
- Use an API (ie. Yelp) to autopopulate some info (ie. hours of operation)
